# RL-

This repo mainly contains a series of mini-project which I attempt to tackle the grid problem via different RL method, both suprivised and un-surprivised:

1. Q-learning 
2. Value iteration
3. Policy iteration

To aid my learning in deep q-learning, I have also dive into machine learning. Inside the 'ML' folder, you can find series of mini-projects to checkpoint my learning.

 1. predicting income against age and experience - Basic gradient descent algo for multi-variable linear regression
 2. Titanic survival problem - Applying logistic regresssion for multi-variable logistic regression (in progress ... )
